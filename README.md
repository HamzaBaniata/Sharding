# Sharding Blockchain Simulator

Used to shard a randomly connected Blockchain network, and then test its security and scalability. Approaches used to shard the network:

1- Random Sharding (commited Dec 2022)

2- Genetic Algorithms (commited May 2023)


# Steps:

1- Clone the repository

2- Modify on the Sim_parametersl.json file (values are self explanatory! if not clear enough, please contact the repo owner"HamzaBaniata")

3- Run main.py (install any missing packages. This code was tested on Linux. It is preferred to run main.py in the terminal not on the editor "e.g. Pycharm".)

4- Once the simulator terminates, check the excel file generated and saved in the same directory ;)
